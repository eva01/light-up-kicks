# light-up-kicks
Light up sneakers (color scales based on pressure). Used Arduino microcontrollers, pressure sensors, and LEDs to build the shoes. 

Credit to Adafruit Firewalker code by Philip Burgess &amp; Clayton Ritcher's code for the Luminous Lowtops project (both were inspirations for my project).
